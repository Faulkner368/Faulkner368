- 👋 Hi, I’m Shaun Faulkner

- 👀 I’m an experienced full stack developer and I'm interested in building web applications; I have worked with .Net, C#, Azure, Entity Framework, Elastich with  Angular / Vue and Javascript / Typescript frontend tech using CSS, HTML and Less / SCSS preprocessors. I have three years commercial experience in these technologies as well as a HND in computer science with Open University under my belt.

- 🌱 I enjoy learning and in my spare time I am practising practice in .Net and Angular or using Python for things like web scraping, Twitter bots, Alexa skills.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on .Net, C#, Entity Framework and/or Angular technologies. I am on the Autistic spectrum (Aspergers) and for this reason I only work remotely (as a reasonable adjustment).

- 📫 How to reach me ? you can message me on LinkedIn [@shaunfaulkner](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shaunfaulkner/)

## More about me

### Volunteering

I enjoy volunteering when I have the time to commit to it and over the last few years I have volunteered for the following tasks / roles:

-	First responder, responding to 999 calls, providing basic life support before an Ambulance arrives, such as CPR.
-	Mountain Safety, I provided support to event patrons on the mountains.
-	Processing daily reports from the crew at the Mars Desert Research Station for the Mars Society

### Interests and hobbies
I enjoy participating in endurance events for 10 years; e.g. a 120 mile coastal ride, double and triple consecutive mountain marathons and I also ran 840 miles of the Wales coastal path for charity, in 5 weeks, raising awareness/money for charity, but now I mostly hike.

I am into Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, for the last year, despite cracking my ribs twice during the beginners course, it’s a great sport for all round fitness, building confidence and keeping ones ego in check since you get submitted a dozen times a session for quite some time until you become competent in the basic; there is no blagging BJJ, speed nor strength, it’s a sport of good technique.

I enjoy learning, building, fixing, solving problems and figuring out how things work. I started self education with a Raspberry Pi; trying to gain the experience in full stack technologies, using Linux OS and configuring Apache / Nginx servers to run the web app. I started with PHP server-side with HTML, CSS and JavaScript frontend and eventually preferred Python to PHP and started building Django apps instead. I also used Python scripts for various automation tasks, such Twitter bots and web scraping.
