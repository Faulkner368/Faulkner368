ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shaun Faulkner

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m an experienced Mid Level Full Stack Developer and I'm interested in building web applications; I work with

  - .Net
  - C#
  - Azure
  - Entity Framework
  - Elastic Search
  - Python
  - Angular
  - Javascript / Typescript
  - SCSS / CSS
  - HTML
  - Accessibility

I have over three years commercial experience in these technologies as well as a HND in computer science with Open University.


### Volunteering

I enjoy volunteering when I have the time to commit to it and over the last few years I have volunteered for the following tasks / roles:

-	First responder, responding to 999 calls, providing basic life support before an Ambulance arrives, such as CPR.
-	Mountain Safety, I provided support to event patrons on racing in the mountains.
-	Processing daily reports from the crew at the Mars Desert Research Station for the Mars Society

### Interests and hobbies
I spent a decade participating in endurance events / challenges; e.g. a 120 mile coastal ride, double and triple consecutive mountain marathons and I also ran 840 miles of the Wales coastal path for charity, in 5 weeks, raising awareness/money for charity, but now I mostly hike.

I enjoy learning, building, fixing, solving problems and figuring out how things work. I started self education with a Raspberry Pi; trying to gain the experience in full stack technologies before starting my degree with OU.
