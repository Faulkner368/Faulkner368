ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shaun Faulkner

**Career-Oriented Bio**  

I am a **Senior Full Stack Developer** at Aiimi Ltd, working on the Aiimi Insight Engine. With over six years of commercial experience, I bring expertise in building robust, accessible, and scalable web applications using a diverse range of technologies, among others including:  

- **.NET / C#**  
- **Angular, NGRX etc**
- **Typescript / JavaScript**  
- **Azure**  
- **Docker**  
- **Elastic Search**  
- **Python**  
- **SCSS / CSS / HTML**  
- **Web Accessibility Standards**  

I am motivated by problem-solving and continuously improving my craft. By day, I focus on creating powerful, user-friendly web application, while my evenings are often dedicated to exploring ad-hoc coding projects and, most recently, delving into **game development**. My journey into tech began with self-education on a Raspberry Pi, gaining full-stack experience before pursuing a **Higher National Diploma in Computer Science (Software)** through the Open University.  

As someone who is **Autistic** and has **ADHD**, I leverage my natural hyperfocus and attention to detail to tackle complex challenges and deliver high-quality accessible solutions. 

### Volunteering  
Volunteering has been a meaningful part of my life. I've contributed to diverse causes, including:  
- **Mountain Safety:** Supporting participants in endurance events and ensuring their safety in challenging conditions.  
- **The Mars Society:** Assisting with daily reports from the Mars Desert Research Station, fostering research into human exploration of Mars.  

### Interests and Hobbies  
Previously, I spent a decade pushing my physical limits through endurance events, culminating in running 840 miles of the **Wales Coastal Path** for charity. Today, I enjoy hiking with my wife and dog, balancing this with managing periods of agoraphobia.  

Driven by a love of learning, I continue to expand my knowledge across software development, emerging technologies, and creative coding.
